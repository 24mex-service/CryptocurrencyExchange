## Platform trading introduction

The characteristic of the platform trading mode is that the platform itself does not generate prices, thereby ensuring the fairness of the price. Trading users and liquidity providers only quote and match around the index price, and the system uses the index price to close the position, thereby avoiding futures exchanges. Due to price deviation or manipulation, it was forced to liquidate.

Index-type CFDs use leverage trading, up to 100 times, and buy N times of digital currency with a small amount of margin. Like stock futures trading, profit or loss is determined by your buying and selling prices, and supports buying and selling. The biggest advantage is the least money, buy the most coins and make more money!

Support long and short two-way transactions, the margin is as low as 1%, and the gain is amplified by 100 times.

<img src="https://github.com/god-exchange/god-exchange/blob/master/demo/images/buy1.png" width="558" height="413"/>
Bitcoin price 50000,

CFD trading:
The purchase deposit of 1 bitcoin is calculated as 1000, and 50 bitcoins can be purchased for 50,000 yuan. When bitcoin rises 10%, your income is 250,000, and the income doubles 50 times.
